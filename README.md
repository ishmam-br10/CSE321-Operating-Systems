# CSE321-Operating-Systems
Welcome to my CSE321 Operating Systems repository! This is where I dump (I mean, organize) all my notes, assignments, slides, and whatever else helps me (and hopefully you) survive this course. Consider this your /home for everything OS-related!


Now dive in to the course. GET INTO LINUX AND C. Feel free to fork, clone, or just leech whatever you need and must run 'sudo rm -rf /' on your life's terminal !
Here are some more things to survive the course:

- [A neat place to learn about OS](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmemes/)
- [Dive into Linux Supremacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE)
- [A great combo to survive this course](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/m65v85/why_are_c_programmers_like_this/)
